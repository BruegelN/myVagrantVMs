## studienabeit
Temporary home of vagrant box for my student research project.
Just a basic __ubuntu/trusty64__ box.
Through __provision.sh__ the following things are installed:
* a lubuntu desktop 
* virtualbox guest additions
* all required tools and libs for OpenCV
* downloading, building and installing OpenCV-3.2.0 (without python bindings)
